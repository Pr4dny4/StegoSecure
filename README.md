# StegoSecure
A Python-based image steganography tool that hides encrypted messages inside images using ROT13 and passcode protection.
# Image Steganography with Encryption

## Introduction
This project implements image steganography by embedding a secret message inside an image without altering its appearance. The message is first encrypted using ROT13 and then hidden within pixel values of the image. The system also includes password protection for added security.

## Features
- **Hidden Messaging**: Securely embeds a secret message within an image.
- **Double Security**: Uses ROT13 encryption along with a passcode for access.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple GUI built with Tkinter for encryption and decryption.
- **Automated Processing**: Encrypts and saves the image with a single click.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **OpenCV (cv2)**: Image processing and manipulation.
- **ROT13 (codecs)**: Simple encryption technique.
- **Tkinter**: GUI for user interaction.
- **OS Module**: File handling and execution.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-steganography.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd image-steganography
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install opencv-python tkinter
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```sh
   python steganography.py
   ```

## Usage
1. **Encrypt Message**
   - Select an image.
   - Enter a secret message and passcode.
   - Click "Encrypt Image" to hide the message in the image.

2. **Decrypt Message**
   - Enter the correct passcode.
   - The hidden message is retrieved and decrypted.

## Future Scope
- Implement **AES encryption** for enhanced security.
- Improve **steganographic techniques** to prevent detection.
- Support **video and audio steganography**.
- Enable **cloud integration** for secure storage and sharing.
- Develop a **mobile application** for real-time encryption.
